# FrameGUI
Entails the coding required to make a GUI to control motors to actuate a test bench.

Use PyQt Serial Code with PyQt_Dials Setter for Knob control of Servo.
Use DoubleServoGUI with DoubleServo_Setter for Slider Functionality.

Fornow (12/12/23) code are for Servo Control AND NOT FOR Linear Actuators.
Provisions to be made soon enough.
